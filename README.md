# CS50-Web-Dev
 The Projects I completed to follow CS50’s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript (https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/).

 CS50's project assignment page is at: https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/0/

 The Projects are as follow:

    Project 0: Design a front-end for Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search (https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/0/search/).

    Project 1: Design a Wikipedia-like online encyclopedia (https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/1/wiki/).

    Project 2: Design an eBay-like e-commerce auction site that will allow users to post auction listings, place bids on listings, comment on those listings, and add listings to a “watchlist.” (https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/2/commerce/)

    Project 3: Design a front-end for an email client that makes API calls to send and receive emails (https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/3/mail/).

    Project 4: Design a Twitter-like social network website for making posts and following users (https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/4/network/).

All Projects are implemented using Django and Javascript except for Project 0 which only uses plain HTML+CSS.
